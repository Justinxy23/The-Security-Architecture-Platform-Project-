# SecureArch Platform 🛡️

## Why I Created This Project

As a cybersecurity student at WGU pursuing my BSCSIA degree, I created this experimental platform to demonstrate my ability to architect comprehensive security solutions. This project serves as a practical showcase of my multi-disciplinary skills in security architecture, combining my knowledge from real-world experience at Cox Automotive and my academic studies.

This experiment tests my capability to:
- Design and implement enterprise-grade security architectures
- Integrate multiple programming languages and frameworks cohesively
- Apply project management methodologies to complex technical challenges
- Create practical solutions that address real security concerns

## The Problem

Modern organizations struggle with:
1. **Fragmented Security Tools**: Security teams use dozens of disconnected tools, making it difficult to maintain a holistic security posture
2. **Lack of Visibility**: No single pane of glass for security architects to monitor, design, and implement security controls
3. **Manual Processes**: Too many security tasks require manual intervention, increasing risk of human error
4. **Skill Gap**: New security professionals need hands-on platforms to practice architecture design

## The Solution

SecureArch Platform provides:
- **Unified Dashboard**: React-based frontend offering real-time security posture visualization
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Python-powered backend for vulnerability assessment and compliance checking
- **Mobile Monitoring**: Swift-based iOS app for on-the-go security alerts and incident response
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS/Azure security service integration for hybrid cloud architectures
- **IAM Simulator**: Practice environment for identity and access management scenarios
- **SIEM-like Analytics**: Log aggregation and threat detection capabilities

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **D3.js** for security visualization and network diagrams
- **Material-UI** for enterprise-grade UI components
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates

### Backend
- **Python 3.11** with FastAPI for high-performance APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** with PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Celery** for asynchronous security scans
- **Redis** for caching and session management

### Mobile
- **SwiftUI** for native iOS development
- **Combine Framework** for reactive programming
- **CryptoKit** for secure data handling

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## Project Management Approach

### Methodology: Agile with SAFe Elements

I'm using a hybrid approach combining:
- **Scrum Framework**: 2-week sprints with defined goals
- **Kanban Board**: Visual workflow management
- **ITIL Practices**: Change management and incident response procedures

### Kanban Board Structure

| Backlog | To Do | In Progress | Testing | Review | Done |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|------|
| Feature ideas | Sprint tasks | Active development | QA & Security testing | Code review | Deployed features |
